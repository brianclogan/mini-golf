## Commands

#### /mgcreatecourse <course_name>

Creates a course with the provided name. The course can then be edited with [/mgedit](#/mgedit).

#### /mgdelete <course_name>

Delete a course.

#### /mgedit <course_name|action>

The `mgedit` command is pretty in-depth. The first time you run it, you declare which course you would like to edit.
The next time you run `mgedit` the following actions will be available for you:

#### /mgreload

Reload Configurations.

#### /mgplay <course_name> (<player_name>)

Have `<player_name>` start a game of mini-golf on the `<course_name>` course. If `<player_name>` is omitted, the command sender is assumed.



## Configurations

The 3 different clubs each have extreme customizability.

There are 3 different ways to hit a ball:
- While sneaking
- While standing
- Critical Hit (While falling)

Furthermore, I've taken the distance the player is from the ball as a factor as well. The further the player is from the ball,
the closer to `max` power they will be. A clubs `y` power is also configurable in the same way. Here is the default wedge configuration:

```
  wedge:
    min_power_sneaking: 0.05
    min_y_power_sneaking: 0.1
    max_power_sneaking: 0.1667
    max_y_power_sneaking: 0.2
    min_power_standing: 0.1667
    min_y_power_standing: 0.1
    max_power_standing: 0.3
    max_y_power_standing: 0.2
    min_power_crit: 0.3
    min_y_power_crit: 0.15
    max_power_crit: 0.45
    max_y_power_crit: 0.2
```

The other configurations have comments explaining what they all mean.
